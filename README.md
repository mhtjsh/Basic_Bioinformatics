# ðŸ¦  Basic Bioinformatics - An  understanding of how Biopython works in general on Python
I am sharing my code repository to understand the basic working and principle of various BioInformatics code in Python; I am writting this github repository with 2 main intensions of mine first and foremost is to build myself a code base to look back onto how I learnt the Bioinformatics and understood how the skeleton of code works/internacts with my subject of intrest i.e. Biology and second is to make you people undertand how the BioPython a popluar Biological library in Python which almost feel like a cheat sheet to solve complex algorithms in Biologial genetic data.

Hence, Let's dive into the journey with me where I start from basic to the complex concepts which is actually necessary to solve the real world calculations in Bioinformatics.
