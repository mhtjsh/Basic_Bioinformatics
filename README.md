# ðŸ¦  Bioinformatics Algorithm 
## An  understanding of how Biopython and its algorithm works generally on Python
I am sharing my code repository to understand the basic working and principle of various BioInformatics code in Python; I am writting this github repository with 2 main intensions of mine first and foremost is to build myself a code base to look back onto how I learnt the Bioinformatics and understood how the skeleton of code works/interacts with my subject of interest i.e. Biology and second is to make you people understand how the BioPython a popluar Biological library in Python which almost feel like a cheat sheet to solve complex algorithms in Biologial genetic data.

Hence, Let's dive into the journey with me where I start from basic to the complex concepts which is actually necessary to solve the real world calculations in Bioinformatics.

## ðŸ§¬ Season 1 - Diggin down deep
A very basic intial Strucutral concept explained which primarirly involves this concepts:
1. Calcuate pattern
2. Frequecney map of DNA sequence
3. Most frequent K-mers
4. Complementary DNA string
5. Pattern Matching

This all seems very intimaidating at first but trust me all of 'em have been explained in a very intresting manner, I urge you to take a look at it and you'll surely thank me later considering that.

## ðŸ§¬ Season 2 - Adding steel rods as skeleton for the building
A bit more complex and tough concepts are being touched upon which needed a lot more efforts to be understood are taken into account here, and I am giving my level best to make it most simpler interpreation of that concept to understand and trying to address each and every question which I had and possibly you could have durning your learning journey.

The primary topics involved here looks like:
1. Symbol Array in DNA Seq
2. Symbol Array but faster (Extended ``SymbolArray``)
3. Skew Array in DNA seq (2 methods explained)
4. Minimum Skew in DNA seq
5. Calcualting Hamming Distance between DNA
6. Approximate Pattern Matching in DNA

## ðŸ§¬ Season 3 - Adding Concrete slurry in the Skeletal Structure
Now season 3 and the upcoming last season involves a bit of Umbrealla type of Code where I will walk you through each and every type of functions seperately and then finally after using that small function codes we will make something very meaningful out of it. 

Therefore, I encourage you to jus stick with me and just enjoy the miracle or magic that you are about to experince at the end durning this journey.
