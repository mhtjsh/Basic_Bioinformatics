# ü¶† Basic Bioinformatics - An  understanding of how Biopython works generally on Python
I am sharing my code repository to understand the basic working and principle of various BioInformatics code in Python; I am writting this github repository with 2 main intensions of mine first and foremost is to build myself a code base to look back onto how I learnt the Bioinformatics and understood how the skeleton of code works/internacts with my subject of intrest i.e. Biology and second is to make you people undertand how the BioPython a popluar Biological library in Python which almost feel like a cheat sheet to solve complex algorithms in Biologial genetic data.

Hence, Let's dive into the journey with me where I start from basic to the complex concepts which is actually necessary to solve the real world calculations in Bioinformatics.

## üß¨ Season 1 - Diggin down deep
### Ep 1 - Let's calcualte the basic Pattern given in the series of Genetic sequence code
üõ†Ô∏è Dataset code
```Python
text = 'ATGCATATGACTACTAGATACTGATACTGATACATA'
pattern = 'ATA'
print(len(pattern))
print(len(text))
print(text[0:3])
```

Let's suppose this is the basic dataset given to us, in which we are asked to find the pattern "ATA" from the Sequence i.e. how much time this particlaur motif occurs or is present in the Parent sequence.

üõ†Ô∏è Program code
```Python
text = 'ATGCATATGACTACTAGATACTGATACTGATACATA'
pattern = 'ATA'
def PatternCount(Text, Pattern):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(Text)-len(Pattern)+1):
        if Text[i:i+len(Pattern)] == Pattern:
            count = count+1 
    return count 
print(PatternCount(text, pattern))
```
Output of this code of line is "5" ie. 5 times ATA motif exist in the whole genome sequence 

### Ep 2 - Understanding the Frequency map 
In this episode, we take the next step in understanding the occurrence of various patterns (k-mers) within a genetic sequence. A frequency map is a dictionary that maps each k-mer to the number of times it appears in the sequence. This is particularly useful for finding motifs or repeated patterns in DNA sequences.

üõ†Ô∏è Program code 
```Python
def FrequencyMap(Text, k):
    freq = {}
    n = len(Text)
    for i in range(n - k + 1):
        Pattern = Text[i:i + k]
        if Pattern in freq:
            freq[Pattern] += 1
        else:
            freq[Pattern] = 1
    return freq

# Example usage
text = 'ACGTTGCATGTCGCATGAGCATGAGAGCT'
k = 3
print(FrequencyMap(text, k))
```
Output of this code looks something like this
```Python
{'ACG': 1, 'CGT': 1, 'GTT': 1, 'TTG': 1, 'TGC': 2, 'GCA': 3, 'CAT': 3, 'ATG': 3, 
 'TGT': 1, 'GTC': 1, 'TCG': 1, 'CGC': 1, 'TGA': 2, 'GAG': 2, 'AGA': 1, 'GCT': 1}
```
where, The function takes a DNA sequence (``Text``) and k-mer length (``k``) as input, extracts all k-mers, and returns a dictionary mapping each k-mer to its count.
